# Privacy Policy

**Really Remote**
**Particle Waves Technology LLC**
**Effective Date: February 7, 2026**

## Overview

Really Remote ("the App") is a mobile application that allows users to remotely interact with tmux terminal sessions on their own devices over a network connection. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with the App.

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal information.**

Particle Waves Technology LLC is founded on the principle that privacy is a natural right. We believe your tools exist for your own productivity, and should not surveil you. Your devices are your property, and your information should only be monetized or otherwise used if you explicitly consent to such an action. We will never store, sell, or exploit your personal data for any purpose.

Note: When you download the App through the Apple App Store, Apple may collect purchase-related information (such as your Apple ID and device type) as part of their transaction process. This data is collected and managed by Apple under their own privacy policy, not by Particle Waves Technology LLC.

The App operates entirely on a peer-to-peer basis between the user's mobile device and the user's own server. Specifically:

- The App does not require account creation or login.
- The App does not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other personal identifiers.
- The App does not collect location data.
- The App does not access the device's camera, microphone, contacts, photos, or other sensitive device features.
- The App does not use cookies, tracking pixels, or similar tracking technologies.
- The App does not contain any analytics, advertising, or third-party tracking SDKs.

## Network Communication

The App connects directly to a WebSocket relay server configured by the user. All network communication occurs exclusively between the user's mobile device and the user's own server. No data is routed through, stored on, or accessible to Particle Waves Technology LLC or any third party as part of the App's operation.

## Data Storage

The App may store default user-configured settings (such as server IP address and port number) locally on the device. This data is not transmitted to Particle Waves Technology LLC or any third party.

## Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate with any third-party services that collect user data. The App does not include any third-party advertising or analytics frameworks.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Because the App collects no personal information, it is compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

Any changes to this policy will be reflected by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this document. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## California Privacy Rights

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have specific rights regarding their personal information. Because the App does not collect, sell, or share any personal information, there is no personal information to disclose, delete, or opt out of selling.

## Nevada Privacy Rights

Under Nevada law, consumers may opt out of the sale of their personal information. The App does not sell personal information.
